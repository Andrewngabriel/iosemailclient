# Mobile Email Client
Lightweight Mobile Email Client using App.js

This was an expirement to develop a cross-platform mobile application using only HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, & PHP.
The main framework used to develop the core application is App.js and it's packaged using Phonegap

As of today 3/20/17 - The application is only able to compose emails however I plan to add more features like loading emails from
server addresses, user authentication, filtering, etc.

Feel free to contribute to the project and add some cool features. I will be working on it myself in the near future.
